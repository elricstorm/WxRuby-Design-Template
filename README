    GEM Related

Ruby 1.9 portability of the wx_sugar gem creates errors that need to be changed.
Change the following lines of wx_sugar/lib/xrc/xrc2ruby_types/outputter.rb:
Change line 39 and line 46 FROM str.each TO str.each_line (save/close)

    Xrcise Related

The xrcise generated ruby file places an xml.load statement for loading xrc files.
The load statement incorrectly loads from a relative path and not an absolute path.
This causes complications when porting your ruby app to an executable that is
unpackaged in a temp directory.

To change this, you need to replace any xml.load statements with:

xml.load(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__),"ui.xrc"))
