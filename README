== Issues

=== Wx_Sugar

|

    GEM Related

Ruby 1.9 portability of the wx_sugar gem creates errors that need to be changed.
Change the following lines of wx_sugar/lib/xrc/xrc2ruby_types/outputter.rb:
Change line 39 and line 46 FROM str.each TO str.each_line (save/close)

    Xrcise Related

The xrcise generated ruby file places an xml.load statement for loading xrc files.
The load statement incorrectly loads from a relative path and not an absolute path.
This causes complications when porting your ruby app to an executable that is
unpackaged in a temp directory.

To change this, you need to replace any xml.load statements with:

xml.load(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__),"ui.xrc"))

Bug has been reported via:

== Lessons

The lesson files located within are mainly reference files that I'm using on
WxRuby screencasts I've created.  There's only a few listed here and they have
no bearing on the template.  You can remove the lessons folder completely if
you don't want it in your template.

== Rakefile

The rakefile has a lot of commands built into it.  The ones you'll want to
become more familiar with are the following commands:

* rake (no arguments necessary)

This will automatically have xrcise create your xrcframemain.rb file from XRC
source.

* rake build

This will automatically have ocra build and create your project for you.  The
build includes image files(.png), icon files(.ico), xrc files(.xrc), and all
source files(.rb).  The app is created as a stand-a-lone executable in your
lib directory.  Keep in mind that you will have to apply the fix for your
xml.load statement in xrcframemain.rb per the issue fix listed above in order
to use the .exe file anywhere on a windows machine.

* other rake commands

Use rake --describe or rake --D to see the other commands and what they do.
